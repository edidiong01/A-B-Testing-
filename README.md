# A/B Testing - Marketing Campaign Analysis 
 To maximize return on investment (ROI) for our clients’ advertising spend, we conducted an A/B test comparing the performance of two major digital advertising platforms: Facebook Ads and Google AdWords. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate which platform delivers superior results across key performance indicators, including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), and overall cost-effectiveness.
By applying A/B testing principles and statistical analysis, we aim to determine whether observed performance differences between the two platforms are statistically significant rather than due to random variation. The findings from this analysis will inform budget allocation decisions, campaign optimization strategies, and future media planning, enabling us to drive better outcomes and higher ROI for our clients.
